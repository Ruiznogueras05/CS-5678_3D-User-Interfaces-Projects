# CS 5678: 3D User Interfaces Projects  

A collection of projects completed during the **3D User Interfaces** course at Cornell Tech, Spring 2024. This course delved into interaction design for virtual and augmented reality applications, focusing on theoretical foundations, design principles, and high-fidelity prototyping. These projects demonstrate innovative approaches to solving challenges in VR interaction, including object selection, manipulation, and hybrid input methods.

## Course Overview  
The **3D User Interfaces** course, taught by **Harald Haraldsson** (Director of the XR Collaboratory at Cornell Tech), explores the field of 3D User Interfaces (3DUIs) and interaction design for virtual and augmented reality applications. Students are tasked with designing, implementing, and evaluating interaction techniques for tasks such as selection, manipulation, travel, and system control for head-mounted displays. 

Additional topics covered include:
- Remote collaboration in virtual environments.
- Advanced input devices and technologies.
- Theoretical foundations and best practices for interaction design.

## Projects Overview  
Below are the three main projects completed during the course, each addressing unique aspects of interaction in virtual environments:

1. [**XRC Go-Go**](https://github.com/Ruiznogueras05/CS-5678_3D-User-Interfaces-Projects/tree/main/XRC_GoGo)  
   - Developed a VR interaction technique allowing users to manipulate objects at a distance using hand movements.
   - Explored how scaling and mapping affect user precision and comfort in VR.

2. [**XRC Balloon Selection**](https://github.com/Ruiznogueras05/CS-5678_3D-User-Interfaces-Projects/tree/main/XRC_BalloonSelection)  
   - Created a VR interface to select and manipulate virtual balloons using a combination of ray casting and proximity-based interaction.
   - Evaluated different techniques for selection accuracy and user preference.

3. [**XRC H-Prism**](https://github.com/Ruiznogueras05/CS-5678_3D-User-Interfaces-Projects/tree/main/XRC_HPrism)  
   - Designed a hybrid VR interaction technique for selecting and rotating virtual prisms.
   - Combined ray-based and grasp-based methods for seamless object manipulation.
